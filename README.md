# OSSP_Nardos_Ayalneh
This project is a basic DOS-style operating system installation. It mimics classic DOS behavior with a command-line interface. Includes essential commands like dir, cd, and copy. Designed for learning how early OS installations worked. Lightweight, bootable, and fun to experiment with!
